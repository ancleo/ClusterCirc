\title{ClusterCirc-Simu}
\usage{
cc_simu(n, samples = 500, alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{= Number of subjects in the sample.}

\item{samples}{= Number of samples for the simulation. Default = 500.
Decrease number of samples for faster computation. Recommended minimum = 100.}

\item{alpha}{= Type-I error in percent for significance testing of deviation
from perfect circumplexity in the data. Options: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
Default = 1 (\%).}
}
\value{
Returns ClusterCirc coefficients for the population data and results for
simulated samples (mean, SD, min, max). Empirical 'spacing (weighted with hÂ²)'
from your data will be compared to the mean value from the simulated
samples with perfect circumplexity to test whether circumplex fit of the
empirical data is acceptable. The empirical spc_h value is compared to a
cutoff value using the standard normal distribution and the chosen alpha
level (one-tailed significance test). The empirical z-value is also given.
}
\description{
Simulates data with perfect circumplex clusters in the population
using parameters from the empirical data (sample size, number of clusters,
number of items, empirical within-cluster range, mean item communality).
Performs ClusterCirc on the simulated data for comparison with results
from ClusterCirc-Data. Choose item communalities (default in cc_data) as
weights for variables in cc_data for adequate comparison.
Number of simulated samples: 500.
