\title{ClusterCirc-Simu}
\usage{
cc_simu(samples = 500, alpha = 1, input = "PCA")
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Number of samples for the simulation. Default = 500.
Decrease number of samples for faster computation. Recommended minimum = 100.}

\item{alpha}{Type-I error in percent for significance testing of deviation
from perfect circumplexity in the data. Options: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
Default = 1 (\%).}

\item{input}{Type of input in cc_data. Options are "PCA" (default),
"Browne", "loadings", or "angles". Choose the same option as in cc_data.
If input is "PCA", "loadings", or "angles", the simulation study uses angles
based on PCA in cc_simu. If input is "Browne", the simulation study uses
item angles based on Browne's procedure CIRCUM.}
}
\value{
Returns ClusterCirc coefficients for the population data and results for
simulated samples (mean, SD, min, max). Empirical 'spacing (weighted with hÂ²)'
from your data will be compared to the mean value from the simulated
samples with perfect circumplexity to test whether circumplex fit of the
empirical data is acceptable. The empirical spc_h value is compared to a
cutoff value using the standard normal distribution and the chosen alpha
level (one-tailed significance test). The empirical z-value is also given.
}
\description{
Simulates data with perfect circumplex clusters in the population
using parameters from the empirical data (sample size, number of clusters,
number of items, empirical within-cluster range, mean item communality).
Performs ClusterCirc on the simulated data to assess circumplex model fit
of the data (results from cc_data). Choose item communalities
(default in cc_data) as weights for variables in cc_data for adequate comparison.
