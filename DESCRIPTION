Description: ClusterCirc analyzes data with circular structure and finds item 
    clusters with optimal circumplex spacing. ClusterCirc is based on item
    angles, either computed from loadings on two orthogonal circumplex axes (e.g.
    from PCA - default - or EFA) or as obtained from Browne's CIRCUM analysis.
    ClusterCirc can sort items into clusters that yield optimal circumplex spacing. 
    Optimal circumplex spacing for item clusters is given if clusters are evenly 
    distributed across the circle (equal spacing between clusters) and if items 
    are clustered closely around their cluster centroid (minimal within-cluster 
    spacing/item heterogeneity). Spacing coefficients are computed to assess 
    circumplex spacing (0 = optimal circumplexity).
    There are three main functions.
    1. cc_data sorts items into clusters with optimal circumplex spacing.
    2. cc_simu can be used to assess circumplex model fit of the data by simulating
    data with perfect circumplex spacing of clusters in the population and computing
    ClusterCirc coefficients as reference values against which cc_data results
    are compared.
    3. cc_fix does not sort items into clusters. Instead, it computes ClusterCirc
    coefficients for user-defined item clusters, which can be compared to results
    for item clusters as suggested by cc_data.
