Description: ClusterCirc analyzes data with circular structure and finds item 
    clusters with optimal circumplex spacing. ClusterCirc is based on item
    loadings on factors or components, which are translated into angles in a 
    circular arrangement. ClusterCirc can sort items into clusters that yield
    optimal circumplex spacing. Optimal circumplex spacing for item clusters is
    given if clusters are evenly distributed across the circle (equal spacing
    between clusters) and if items are clustered closely around their cluster 
    centroid (minimal within-cluster spacing/item heterogeneity). Spacing 
    coefficients are computed to assess circumplex spacing (0 = optimal circumplexity).
    There are three main functions.
    1. cc_data sorts items into clusters with optimal circumplex spacing.
    2. cc_simu creates samples from a population with perfect circumplex
    spacing of clusters and the specifications of the data to compare with
    the spacing coefficients from cc_data.
    3. cc_fix does not sort items into clusters. Instead, it computes ClusterCirc
    coefficients for user-defined item clusters, which can be compared to results
    for item clusters as suggested by cc_data.
