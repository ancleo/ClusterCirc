Description: ClusterCirc analyzes data with circular structure and finds item 
    clusters with optimal circumplex spacing. ClusterCirc is based on item
    loadings on factors or components, which are translated into angles in a 
    circular arrangement. ClusterCirc can sort items into clusters that yield
    optimal circumplex spacing. Optimal circumplex spacing for item clusters is
    given if clusters are evenly distributed across the circle (equal spacing
    between clusters) and if items are clustered closely around their cluster 
    centroid (minimal within-cluster spacing). Spacing coefficients are
    computed to assess circumplex spacing (0 = optimal circumplexity).
    There are two functions for users.
    1. cc_data sorts items into clusters with optimal circumplex spacing.
    2. cc_simu creates samples from a population with perfect circumplex
    spacing of clusters and the specifications of the data to assess circumplex 
    fit of the data.
